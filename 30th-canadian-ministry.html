            The Thirtieth Canadian Ministry is the cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Mark Carney, and which has governed Canada since Justin Trudeau vacated the office. Following the election of Carney as Leader of the Liberal Party, he and his ministers were sworn in on March 14, 2025, in a ceremony at Rideau Hall. Carney shrunk the cabinet from 37 ministers under Trudeau, to 23 plus himself. The imminent 2025 Canadian federal election will decide whether the ministry continues, or is replaced.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Lists of Ministers ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Changes compared to the Twenty-Ninth Ministry ==<br/><br/>The following positions were altered compared to the end of the Twenty-Ninth Ministry:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Merged positions ===<br/><br/>Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Rural Economic Development: Previously two posts, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Rural Economic Development.<br/><br/>Minister of Canadian Culture and Identity, Parks Canada and Quebec Lieutenant: A new position combining the previous post of Minister of Canadian Heritage with the responsibility for Parks Canada, previously held by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change.<br/><br/>Minister of Jobs and Families: Previously two posts, the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour and the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development.<br/><br/>Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development: Previously two posts, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of International Development.<br/><br/>Minister of International Trade and Intergovernmental Affairs: A new position combining the previous post of Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development with the responsibility for intergovernmental affairs, previously held by the Minister of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs.<br/><br/>Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness: Previously two posts, the Minister of Public Safety and the Minister of Emergency Preparedness.
