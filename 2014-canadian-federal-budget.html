            The Canadian federal budget for fiscal year 2014–15 was presented to the House of Commons of Canada by Jim Flaherty on 11 February 2014. This was the last budget presented by the Finance Minister before his resignation in March and death in April. At the end of the fiscal year, the government was surprised to post a budgetary surplus of  $1.9 billion. This however would later be overturned to a small deficit of $550 million due to improper accounting methodologies for the Government's unfunded pension obligations, as pointed out for years by the Auditor General.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Programs ==<br/><br/>The budget cut CA$3,100,000,000 from the Department of National Defence budget allocated for procurement of equipment via the Canada First Defence Strategy. Flaherty stated the funds would be restored in the future when "key purchases will be made".<br/><br/>The government announced a plan to establish the National Disaster Mitigation Program, which it would begin funding in the 2015–2016 fiscal year under the 2015 budget. The program "will invest in structural mitigation projects" and provide residential flood insurance in conjunction with provincial, territorial, and private insurance plans.<br/><br/>The budget established the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, which was to receive $50 million in the 2015–2016 fiscal year for research funding at post-secondary institutions. Four grant councils, including the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, would receive a combined $46 million annually.
