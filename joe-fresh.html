            Joe Fresh is a Canadian fashion brand and retail chain created by designer Joe Mimran for Canadian food distributor Loblaw Companies Limited. It was formed in 2006. The label includes adult and children's wear, shoes, handbags, jewellery, beauty products, and bath items.<br/><br/>Joe Fresh entered the United States market, with permanent and pop-up stores, in New York City and the surrounding region, with an international flagship store located at 510 Fifth Avenue. In 2012, the brand also appeared in approximately 680 JCPenney stores throughout the United States.<br/><br/>The JCPenney agreement was dismantled in 2015, with the companies making the decision not to renew their existing distribution agreement, which expired on January 30, 2016. The Fifth Avenue store closed in 2015.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Concept ===<br/><br/>In 2004, Loblaw approached Joe Mimran, co-founder of the Club Monaco retail chain and the name behind the Alfred Sung brand, to collaborate on a new fashion line. Mimran, who had previously worked with Loblaw on its President's Choice Home Collection, was tasked with creating a clothing line for adults, a market segment the company had not explored before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"We had no idea what the consumer would want from a food store; we had no idea whether the prices would resonate, whether they wanted casual dress versus something dressier.
