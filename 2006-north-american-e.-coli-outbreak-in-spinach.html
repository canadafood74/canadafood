            The 2006 North American E. coli outbreak was an Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak from prepackaged spinach reported in 27 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario. The outbreak cases spanned from August 30 to October 6, and its origin was traced back to a farm in San Benito County, California. At least 276 consumer illnesses and 3 deaths have been attributed as a result from the outbreak.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In September 2006, there was an outbreak of foodborne illness caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria found in prepackaged spinach in 26 U.S. states. The initial reports of the outbreak came from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/><br/>By October 6, 2006, 199 people had been infected, including three people who died and 31 who developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic–uremic syndrome after eating spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, a potentially deadly bacterium that causes bloody diarrhea and dehydration. This strain is more potent than in any other food poisoning scares. Federal health officials said half of those reported sick have been hospitalized, compared to 25 to 30 percent in past outbreaks.<br/><br/>The FDA called for bagged fresh spinach to be removed from shelves and warned people not to eat any fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products. The FDA has also speculated that washing the spinach is insufficient to sanitize it because the bacteria is systemic, meaning that it is not just on the outside of the spinach, but that it has been absorbed through the roots and is now inside the spinach.
