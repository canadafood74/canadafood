            The Canadian Food and Allied Workers (CFAW) was a Canadian meatpacking labour union which existed from 1968 until 1979. It was created as a result of a merger between Canadian locals of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters (AMC) and the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA). In 1979, it merged with the Retail Clerks International Union (RCIU) along with its American counterpart (which had maintained the AMC name) to form the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origins ===<br/><br/>The Canadian Food and Allied Workers came into existence during a time of turbulence in the Canadian political sphere, as well as rapid industrial consolidation, followed by consolidation of the unions in these industries. It also marked the consolidation of two different traditions of unionism in the meatpacking industry: the craft unionism exemplified by the older Amalgamated Meat Cutters (AMC), created during the late-19th-century heyday of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and the militant industrial unionism of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA), which grew out of the wave of 1930s Great Depression-era organizing resulting from the foundation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).<br/><br/>By the late 1960s, steps began to be taken to merge the two unions, which had a history of rivalry and competition for membership due to their overlapping membership categories. In Canada, the most dynamic and progressive leadership came from the leaders and organizers of the former United Packinghouse Workers, such as Fred Dowling, known as "Mr. Packinghouse", and Romeo Mathieu, his protégé. The merger was completed in 1968, with the American UPWA membership being absorbed into the AMC, while in Canada the CFAW was formed as a neutral path forward for the combined membership.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Fisheries organizing ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The CFAW leadership had a history in the Canadian social-democratic political tradition of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the New Democratic Party (NDP), as well as the efforts toward social change in Québec's Quiet Revolution.
