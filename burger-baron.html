            The Burger Baron name is used by several fast-food restaurants in western Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Burger Baron was founded  in 1957 by Jack McDonnell. It was founded in either Calgary or Lethbridge, Alberta (the location and ownership of the first site is disputed), Burger Baron was the first drive-in chain in Western Canada. The company expanded quickly throughout the region but suffered when the big American chains began to move to the area. The original franchise operation collapsed into bankruptcy and current restaurants are independently operated, with different menus, recipes, signage and advertising. Today, there are still dozens of Burger Barons throughout Western Canada, but they are mostly concentrated around Edmonton and in small towns in Alberta. Many of the owners are Lebanese Canadians, connected to Rudy Kemaldean of Edmonton, who bought the first of his seven restaurants in 1965, hired family and friends and encouraged them to open their own operations under the Burger Baron name. <br/><br/>Among other things, Burger Baron is famous for being endorsed by former Edmonton Oilers hockey coach Glen Sather and other former members of the Edmonton Oilers.<br/><br/>Several Burger Baron buildings formerly belonged to other chains. Five of them were part of the local Burger King chain, once Burger Baron's main rival, which became defunct when the worldwide Burger King company acquired the rights to the name for northern Alberta in 1995.
