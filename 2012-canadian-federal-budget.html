            In Canada, federal budgets are presented annually by the Government of Canada to identify planned government spending and expected government revenue, and to forecast economic conditions for the upcoming year. They are usually released in February or March, before the start of the fiscal year.<br/><br/>All the Canadian provinces also present budgets. Since provincial finances depend on funds from the federal government, they are usually released after the federal budget.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Budget process ==<br/><br/>The budget is announced in the House of Commons by the Minister of Finance, who traditionally wears new shoes while doing so. The Budget is then voted on by the House of Commons.  Budgets are a confidence measure, and if the House votes against it the government can fall, as happened to Prime Minister Joe Clark's government in 1980.  The governing party strictly enforces party discipline, usually expelling from the party caucus any government Member of Parliament (MP) who votes against the budget.  Opposition parties almost always vote against the budget.  In cases of minority government, the government has normally had to include major concessions to one of the smaller parties to ensure passage of the budget.
