<h1>Top Chef Canada season 9</h1>
            
            The ninth season of the Canadian reality television series Top Chef Canada and was first broadcast on Food Network. The new season was first announced by Food Network Canada on March 31, 2021. The season was filmed in Toronto, Ontario and the finale was shot at the Four Seasons hotel in the city's downtown core. Season nine features 11 chefs of various backgrounds considered to be the next generation of culinary stars in Canada.<br/><br/>The season reflected on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food industry. Chefs wore masks when shopping for produce, travelling between destinations and during several challenges, which were adapted to follow pandemic restrictions, most notably with "Takeout Wars," an adaptation of the classic challenge "Restaurant Wars," where chefs conducted a takeout service instead of a pop-up restaurant, and where the Judges ate at resident judge Janet Zuccarini's own home. <br/><br/>Season 9 featured Eden Grinshpan again as host, and kept all of its mainstay judges, including Head Judge Mark McEwan, along with resident judges Christ Nuttall-Smith, Mijune Pak and Janet Zuccarini, who rotated through judging elimination challenges, with at least one resident judge present per episode, but at times featured two or all resident judges on some given episodes.<br/><br/>Top Chef Canada: Season 9 premiered on April 19, 2021, and concluded on June 7, 2021. In the season finale, Erika Kerbelnik was declared the winner over runner-up Kym Nguyen. For winning the competition, Karbelnik was awarded the grand prize of $100,000 (CAD) and a new Lexus branded vehicle.
