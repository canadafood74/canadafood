            The imperial system of units, imperial system or imperial units (also known as British Imperial or Exchequer Standards of 1826) is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act 1824 and continued to be developed through a series of Weights and Measures Acts and amendments.<br/><br/>The imperial system developed from earlier English units as did the related but differing system of customary units of the United States. The imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards, which were in effect from 1588 to 1825. The system came into official use across the British Empire in 1826.<br/><br/>By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement, but imperial units are still used alongside metric units in the United Kingdom and in some other parts of the former empire, notably Canada.<br/><br/>The modern UK legislation defining the imperial system of units is given in the Weights and Measures Act 1985 (as amended).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Implementation ==<br/><br/>The Weights and Measures Act 1824 was initially scheduled to go into effect on 1 May 1825. The Weights and Measures Act 1825 pushed back the date to 1 January 1826. The 1824 act allowed the continued use of pre-imperial units provided that they were customary, widely known, and clearly marked with imperial equivalents.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Apothecaries' units ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apothecaries' units are not mentioned in the acts of 1824 and 1825.
