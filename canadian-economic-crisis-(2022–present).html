            The Canadian economic crisis is a period of elevated economic instability in Canada beginning after the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Although several economic indicators have shown signs of weakness, there is no consensus among analysts that these constitute a systemic economic crisis. The causes of Canada's current economic difficulties are complex and reflect both domestic factors, such as fiscal and monetary policy, and broader international influences, including supply chain disruptions and demographic shifts. <br/><br/>Public debate around the state of the economy intensified in 2024, contributing to heightened political tensions and the resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. <br/><br/>Discussions of Canada's economic performance have been used in political narratives across the spectrum, with differing interpretations about the extent to which federal government policies have contributed to recent economic conditions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Canada's economic position has shifted since the 1980s, when it maintained a nearly US$4,000 advantage in per capita GDP compared to an average of the G7 nations over the same period of time. By 2000, the United States had established a US$8,000 lead over Canada. The situation deteriorated further after a 2014-15 shock in oil prices, with Canadian per-capita real GDP growing at just 0.4% annually, lower than other G7 nations.<br/><br/>From 2011 to 2019, Canada achieved similar growth as the U.S., averaging 2.2% annually, exceeding the growth of other G7 nations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and following recovery, Canadian growth declined to 1.1%, falling behind the U.S. rate of 1.7%.
