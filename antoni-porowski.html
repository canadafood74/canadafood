            Antoni Janusz Porowski (born March 14, 1984) is a Canadian television personality, cook, actor, model, and author. He is the food and wine expert on the Netflix series Queer Eye (2018–present).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Porowski was born in Montreal, Quebec, to Polish parents after they immigrated to Canada with his two older sisters. His father is a physician. He grew up speaking Polish, English and French. He and his parents moved to Glade Springs, West Virginia, when he was twelve years old; he resided between there and in Montreal throughout his high school years before returning to Montreal to complete his post-secondary education at Marianopolis College.<br/><br/>After graduating from Concordia University with a bachelor's degree in psychology, Porowski moved to New York City to study acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, from which he graduated in 2011. He taught himself to cook as a college student.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Upon moving to New York City, Porowski began auditioning for various acting roles. He has stated that his Polish last name made it difficult for him to find work, which at the time made him consider anglicizing his last name.
