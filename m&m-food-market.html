            M&amp;M Food Market Ltd. (French: Les aliments M&amp;M), formerly known as M&amp;M Meat Shops, is a Canadian frozen food retail chain. The company is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, and has locations in all ten provinces, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories; the company formerly had operations in the Midwestern United States under the MyMenu brand that operated between 2008 and 2013.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin ==<br/><br/>M&amp;M was founded by Michael "Mac" Voisin and Mark Nowak in Kitchener, Ontario, in 1980. Voisin's and Nowak's original business model was to provide good quality meat at lower prices. The partners discovered that flash-frozen meats retained their freshness with Canadian-grown (Health Canada safe) meats with no steroids, added preservatives and no torture farms. But because they could be stored over a longer term, could be sold at a price comparable to supermarket meats.<br/><br/>M&amp;M locations are generally small outlets in strip malls, consisting of several freezers and a counter acting as a point of sale. Store employees are known as "Meal Advisors," who are trained to assist customers by suggesting products and meal ideas.<br/><br/>In addition to the head office in Mississauga, M&amp;M has regional offices in Montreal, Quebec and Calgary, Alberta.
