            Doubles is a common street food originating in Trinidad and Tobago and is of Indo-Trinidadian origin. It consists of curried chickpeas served on two fried flatbreads. It is normally eaten during breakfast, but is also eaten occasionally during lunch or as a late-night snack and popular hangover food.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>Doubles as a dish was created in Princes Town by Emamool "Mamoodeen" Deen and his wife Raheman Rasulan Deen in 1936. Deen used to sell curried chickpeas over single fried flatbread with chutneys. When his customers began requesting to double the bara in their orders the name “doubles” was coined.<br/><br/>It has been speculated that it was inspired by a northern Indian dish called chole bhature (or sometimes channa bhatura). Chole bhature is made by combining channa masala and bhature (poori), which is a fried bread made with maida flour, a common flour in Indian baking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Preparation ==<br/><br/>As a base for the curry, onions, garlic and curry powder or plain turmeric powder are fried briefly. Boiled and drained chickpeas are added together with some water and spices, primarily cumin.
