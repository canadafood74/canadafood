            A greasy spoon is a small, cheap restaurant typically specializing in short order fare.<br/><br/>The term is also used in the UK–along with the informal term "caff" for café–to refer to a small privately-owned eatery that traditionally serves fry-ups and other quick meals.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Term ==<br/><br/>The term greasy spoon—used to describe small and inexpensive diners and coffee shops—became popular in the United States as early as the 1920s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nicknaming cheap restaurants after an unwashed spoon dates back at least to 1848: The Gabbione [in Rome] ... has withal an appearance so murky and so very far removed from cleanliness, that the Germans have bestowed upon it the appellation of the 'Dirty Spoon'.<br/><br/>The earliest appearance in print of the specific term "greasy spoon" was in 1906, in a story in Macmillan's Magazine, referring to an eatery in Paris frequented for a time by Robert Louis Stevenson:<br/><br/><br/><br/>A tradition exists in the studios of Montparnasse, where Stevenson has already become almost a legendary figure, that "cousin Bob" (R.A.M. Stevenson, the well-known art-critic) one day found his relative moping in the darkest corner of the Cremerie in the Rue Delambre, – an eating-house much frequented by artists, and familiarly known as The Greasy Spoon...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Menu ==<br/><br/>Many typical American and Canadian greasy spoon diners focus on griddled, grilled, or fried food, such as hamburgers, french fries, chili, eggs and omelettes, <br/><br/>bacon, sausages, pancakes, waffles, <br/><br/>fried chicken, Spam, and fish and chips.<br/><br/>Sandwiches are also popular, as are beef stew, baked beans, and hearty soups. Regional fare is often served. Since the 1970s, many Greek immigrants have entered the business.
