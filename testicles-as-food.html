            The testicles of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. Testicles are a by-product of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were originally a late-spring seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally available year-round.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cookery ==<br/><br/>Testicles are cooked in a variety of ways: sautéed and sauced, fricasseed, deep-fried with breading or batter, in pies, poached, roasted, and so on. Before cooking, they are generally scalded, skinned, and soaked in cold water.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Names ==<br/><br/>In English, testicles are known by a wide variety of euphemisms, including stones, Rocky Mountain oysters, and prairie oysters. Lamb testicles are often called lamb fries or simply fries (though that may also refer to other organ meats).<br/><br/>Euphemisms are used in many other languages. In Arabic countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Iraq they are known as baid ghanam and in Turkey they are known as koç yumurtası, which in both languages mean 'sheep eggs'.<br/><br/>In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, they are known as criadillas, huevos de toro 'bull eggs'; in Chinese they are known as simplified Chinese: 牛宝; traditional Chinese: 牛寶; pinyin: niú bǎo; lit. 'ox treasures'; in Greek as αμελέτητα 'unmentionables'; in Hindi as kapura; and in Nepali as gula/rajkhani.
