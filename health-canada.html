            Health Canada (HC; French: Santé Canada, SC) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for national health policy. The department itself is also responsible for numerous federal health-related agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), among others. These organizations help to ensure compliance with federal law in a variety of healthcare, agricultural, and pharmaceutical activities. This responsibility also involves extensive collaboration with various other federal- and provincial-level organizations in order to ensure the safety of food, health, and pharmaceutical products—including the regulation of health research and pharmaceutical manufacturing/testing facilities.<br/><br/>The department is responsible to Parliament through the minister of health as part of the federal health portfolio. The deputy minister of health, the senior most civil servant within the department, is responsible for the day-to-day leadership and operations of the department and reports directly to the minister.<br/><br/>Originally created as the "Department of Health" in 1919—in the wake of the Spanish flu crisis—what is known as Health Canada today was formed in 1993 from the former Health and Welfare Canada department (established in 1944), which split into two separate units; the other department being Human Resources and Labour Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Organization ==<br/><br/>Health Canada's leadership consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Minister of Health<br/><br/>Deputy Minister<br/><br/>Associate Deputy Minister<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Branches ===<br/><br/>The following branches, offices, and bureaus (and their respective services) fall under the jurisdiction of Health Canada:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Partner agencies ===<br/><br/>In their responsibility of maintaining and improving the health of Canadians, the Minister of Health is supported by the Health Portfolio, which comprises Health Canada as well as:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Public Health Agency of Canada;<br/><br/>Canadian Institutes of Health Research;<br/><br/>the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board; and<br/><br/>the Canadian Food Inspection Agency<br/><br/>Additionally, Health Canada is a corporate partner of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== International collaboration ====<br/><br/>In December 2016, Health Canada approved the purchase of a new botulism antitoxin called heptavalent botulism antitoxin (BAT) from the American-based company Emergent Biosolutions, a global specialty biopharmaceutical company. The PHAC has identified botulism as a likely biological terrorist threat.
