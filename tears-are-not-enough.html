            "Tears Are Not Enough" is a 1985 charity single recorded by a supergroup of Canadian artists, under the name Northern Lights, to raise funds for relief of the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia. It was one of a number of such supergroup singles recorded between December 1984 and April 1985, along with Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" in the United Kingdom, USA for Africa's "We Are the World" in the United States, "Cantaré, cantarás" by a supergroup of Latin American and Spanish singers, Chanteurs sans Frontières's "Éthiopie" in France, and Fondation Québec-Afrique's "Les Yeux de la faim" in Quebec.<br/><br/>Although recorded independently of the USA for Africa project, it was included on the full-length We Are the World album.<br/><br/>The project was organized by Bruce Allen, who brought together a large group of artists to record a song written by David Foster, Jim Vallance, Bryan Adams, Rachel Paiement, Paul Hyde and Bob Rock. Foster and Vallance wrote the music and initial lyrics, Adams completed the English lyrics, Paiement wrote the one French verse, Rock &amp; Hyde contributed the song title. The song was recorded on February 10, 1985 at Manta Sound studios in Toronto.<br/><br/>Foster revealed the melody of the song was originally offered to filmmaker Joel Schumacher as incidental music for his film St. Elmo's Fire. Schumacher reported hated it but was later, in Foster's words, "really pissed" when it showed up later as a charity single.<br/><br/>The song was issued as the album's second and final single by Columbia Records on May 1, 1985, and quickly reached number one on the Canadian Top 40 chart.
