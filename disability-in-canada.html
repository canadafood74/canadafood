            Disability in Canada affects approximately 8 million individuals aged 15 and older. According to the 2022 survey by Statistics Canada of those reporting a disability nearly 42% of seniors had four or more co-occurring disabilities, while 43% of youth and 36% of working-age adults had two or three types. The disability rate was higher for women (30%) compared to men (24%), consistent with past trends. In terms of severity of disabilities, about 59% of disabled persons were classified as having milder disabilities, while 41% had more severe disabilities.<br/><br/>Despite significant gains for people with disabilities in recent decades, there is historical and modern discrimination issues. From the late 1800s to the mid 20th century, Canadian immigration laws prohibited people who were perceived to have intellectual or developmental disabilities from entering the country. People with disabilities within Canada have faced institutionalization, involuntary sterilization, employment denialism and emotional and physical violence. Those with disabilities continue to have lower educational achievement, higher unemployment rates, thus are more likely to experience low income, and inadequate housing compared to those without disabilities. Findings show that 72% of people with disabilities encountered one or more accessibility barriers due to their condition.<br/><br/>Domestic legislation intended to protect disabled Canadians include the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the Employment Equity Act.
