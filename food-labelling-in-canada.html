            Federal responsibility for Canadian food labelling requirements is shared between two departments, Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).<br/><br/>All labelling information that is provided on food labels or in advertisements, as required by legislation, must be accurate, truthful and not misleading. Ingredient lists must accurately reflect the contents and their relative proportions in a food. Nutrition facts tables must accurately reflect the amount of a nutrient present in a food. Net quantity declarations must accurately reflect the amount of food in the package. Certain claims, such as those relating to nutrient content, organic, kosher, halal and certain disease-risk reduction claims, are subject to specific regulatory requirements in addition to the prohibitions in the various acts. For claims that are not subject to specific regulatory requirements, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and/or Health Canada provide interpretive guidance that assist industry in compliance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Primary functions ==<br/><br/>According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, a food label serves three primary functions:<br/><br/><br/><br/>it provides basic product information (including common name, list of ingredients, net quantity, durable life date, grade/quality, country of origin and name and address of manufacturer, dealer or importer);<br/><br/>it provides health, safety, and nutrition information. This includes instructions for safe storage and handling, nutrition information such as the quantity of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals present per serving of stated size of the food (in the nutrition facts table), and specific information on products for special dietary use;<br/><br/>it acts as a vehicle for food marketing, promotion and advertising (via label vignettes, promotional information and label claims such as low fat, cholesterol-free, high source of fibre, product of Canada, natural, organic, no preservatives added, and so on).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Requirements ==<br/><br/>Some of the core labelling requirements that are set out by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency include:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Common name ===<br/><br/>The common name of a product is the label that someone will see when they pick up a product.
