            Vanilla extract is a solution made by macerating and percolating vanilla pods in a solution of ethanol and water. It is considered an essential ingredient in many Western desserts, especially baked goods like cakes, cookies, brownies, and cupcakes, as well as custards, ice creams, and puddings. Although its primary flavor compound is vanillin, pure vanilla extract contains several hundred additional flavor compounds, which are responsible for its complex, deep flavor. By contrast, artificial vanilla flavor is typically  made up of only artificially derived vanillin, which is frequently made from a by-product of the wood pulp industry.<br/><br/>Vanilla extract is the most common form of vanilla used today. Malagasy, Mexican, Tahitian, Indonesian, and Ugandan vanilla beans are the main varieties used today. The term "Bourbon vanilla" refers to the vanilla beans' provenance as being from the Bourbon Islands, most commonly Madagascar but also Mauritius and Réunion. The name comes from the period when the island of Réunion was ruled by the Bourbon kings of France and has no relation to Bourbon whiskey.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Legal definitions ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== US regulations ===<br/><br/>In the United States, in order for a vanilla extract to be called pure, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that the solution contain a minimum of 35% alcohol and 100g of vanilla beans per litre (13.35 ounces per gallon). Double and triple strength (up to 20-fold) vanilla extracts are also available, although these are primarily used for manufacturing and food service purposes where the amount of liquid in a recipe needs to be carefully monitored.
