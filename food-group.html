            Food groups categorise foods for educational purposes, usually grouping together foods with similar nutritional properties or biological classifications. Food groups are often used in nutrition guides, although the number of groups used can vary widely.<br/><br/>Food groups were a public health education concept invented to teach people eating very restricted, unvaried diets how to avoid becoming deficient in specific nutrients. They have since been adapted to also address diseases of affluence related to diet, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Historical food groups ==<br/><br/>Opson and sitos were Classical Greek food groups, mainly used for moral education, to teach sophrosyne. Mitahara, a concept of moderate diet found in early-first-millennium Sanskrit texts, categorizes food into groups and recommends eating a variety of healthy foods, while avoiding the unhealthy ones; it also considers foods to have emotional and moral effects. Indian foodways had a substantial influence on European organisations such as the Vegetarian Society, which cited Indian diets as proof that a healthy vegetarian diet was possible, and were actively involved in public debate on nutrition.<br/><br/>In the 20th century, food groups became widely used in public health education, as a tool to reduce nutritional deficiencies.<br/><br/>As early as the 1980s, researchers were criticizing food groups, saying that they were a concept useful for teaching people to avoid nutritional deficiencies, but that nutritional deficiencies were no longer major cause of diet-related disease in affluent societies. Since these are caused by unhealthy food, not by diets lacking of a specific nutrient, they thought that food groups would have to be entirely discarded, or entirely revamped to make them useful in nutritional education in post-industrial countries.
