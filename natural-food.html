            Natural food and all-natural food are terms in food labeling and marketing with several definitions, often implying foods that are not manufactured by processing. In some countries like the United Kingdom, the term "natural" is defined and regulated; in others, such as the United States, the term natural is not enforced for food labels, although there is USDA regulation of organic labeling.<br/><br/>The term is assumed to describe foods having ingredients that are intrinsic to an unprocessed food.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Diverse definitions ==<br/><br/>While almost all foodstuffs are derived from the natural products of plants and animals, 'natural foods' are often assumed to be foods that are not processed, or do not contain any food additives, or do not contain particular additives such as hormones, antibiotics, sweeteners, food colors, preservatives, or flavorings that were not originally in the food.  In fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers) that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients.<br/><br/>The term is variously misused on labels and in advertisements. The international Food and Agriculture Organization's Codex Alimentarius does not recognize the term 'natural' but does have a standard for organic foods.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The origin of the idea of "natural foods" has been traced to Sylvester Graham in the 1830s. Graham argued that processed foods contravened God's laws of health and that whole wheat should be eaten in its natural unadulterated form. He described baking bread with white flour as "unnatural".
