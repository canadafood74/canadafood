            Flavour Network (formerly Food Network) is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel majority-owned by Corus Entertainment, with minority interests owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Nexstar Media Group (via Television Food Network G.P.). It broadcasts programming related to food, cooking, cuisine, and the food industry, including competition, reality, and travelogue-style programs. <br/><br/>The channel was originally established on October 9, 2000 as a Canadian version of the American cable channel Food Network, in a joint venture between Corus, Alliance Atlantis, and Food Network U.S. majority owner E. W. Scripps Company. It replaced the U.S. version of Food Network (which had been distributed in Canada since 1997) on television providers. Through various ownership changes, Corus Entertainment later became the majority owner of the channel.<br/><br/>In June 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired Canadian rights to Warner Bros. Discovery factual and lifestyle television brands beginning in 2025, including Food Network. Rogers announced its intent to relaunch Food Network as a new discretionary specialty channel on January 1, 2025. Corus announced that it would continue to operate its existing Food Network channel under a new brand, replacing Food Network U.S. programming with other acquisitions to accompany its existing Canadian productions.
