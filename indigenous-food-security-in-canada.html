            For many Indigenous communities in Canada, food insecurity is a major, ongoing problem. A variety of factors, from poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic, government inaction and climate change, exacerbated by both historical and ongoing discrimination faced by Indigenous Canadians, have played a role in the creation of this crisis.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Socioeconomic factors and prevalence ==<br/><br/>Indigenous peoples are at a higher risk than non-Indigenous peoples to experience food insecurity. Food insecurity is directly linked to being in a low-income household, and Indigenous people on average experience higher amounts of income inequality than non-Indigenous peoples. A November 2019 report found that 48% of First Nations households were food insecure, with provinces such as Alberta having numbers as high 60%. First Nations children, in particular, experience major food insecurity.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Accessibility and availability ==<br/><br/>In one community (according to one 2002 study), it was the consensus that the price of market foods in a northern community were very high, and that there needed to be government-implemented policies that would help lower the cost of food in more remote locations. In the 2020s, food insecurity still remains a major issue for Inuk people, as it has been noted that food prices are still unsustainably high, despite attempts by Canadian government agencies to lower them. In 2022, Manitoban First Nations also expressed concerns about dealing with rising food prices.<br/><br/>Other barriers for obtaining a steady diet of traditional food include hunting equipment costs, transportation, and a lack of knowledgeable hunters and fishers are just some of the reasons consumption of traditional food has proven to be difficult.
