            Powdered milk, also called milk powder, dried milk, or dry milk, is a manufactured dairy product made by evaporating milk to dryness. One purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. Another purpose is to reduce its bulk for the economy of transportation. Powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat (skimmed) dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products and dry dairy blends.  Many exported dairy products conform to standards laid out in Codex Alimentarius.<br/><br/>Powdered milk is used for food as an additive, for health (nutrition), and also in biotechnology (saturating agent).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and manufacture ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>While Marco Polo wrote of Mongolian Tatar troops in the time of Kublai Khan who carried sun-dried skimmed milk as "a kind of paste", the first modern production process for dried milk was invented by the Russian doctor Osip Krichevsky in 1802. The first commercial production of dried milk was organized by the Russian chemist M. Dirchoff in 1832. In 1855, T. S. Grimwade took a patent on a dried milk procedure, though William Newton had patented a vacuum drying process as early as 1837.<br/><br/>In modern times, powdered milk is usually made by spray drying nonfat skimmed milk, whole milk, buttermilk or whey.
