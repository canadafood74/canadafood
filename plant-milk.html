            Plant oils or vegetable oils are oils derived from plant sources, as opposed to animal fats or petroleum. There are three primary types of plant oil, differing both the means of extracting the relevant parts of the plant, and in the nature of the resulting oil:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vegetable fats and oils were historically extracted by putting part of the plant under pressure, squeezing out the oil.<br/><br/>Macerated oils consist of a base oil to which parts of plants are added.<br/><br/>Essential oils are composed of volatile aromatic compounds, extracted from plants by distillation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Vegetable fats and oils ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Vegetable fats and oils are what are most commonly called vegetable oils. These are triglyceride-based, and include cooking oils like canola oil, solid oils like cocoa butter, oils used in paint like linseed oil and oils used for industrial purposes. Pressed vegetable oils are extracted from the plant containing the oil (usually the seed), using one of two types of oil press. The most common is the screw press, which consists of a large-diameter metal screw inside a metal housing. Oil seeds are fed into the housing, where the screws mash the seeds, and create pressure which forces the oil out through small holes in the side of the press. The remaining solids, called seed cake, are either discarded or used for other purposes.
