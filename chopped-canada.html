<h1>Chopped Canada</h1>
            
            Chopped Canada is a Canadian reality cooking competition series that was broadcast by Food Network Canada from 2014 to 2017. It was a Canadian adaptation of the U.S. Chopped franchise. In May 2017, it was reported that the series had been cancelled by Food Network after four seasons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Format ==<br/><br/>In each episode, four chefs go head to head and compete to create a delicious three course meal.  The competition is divided into three rounds: "Appetizer", "Entrée", and "Dessert". In each round, the chefs are presented with a mystery basket containing four ingredients, and the challenge is to incorporate those mystery ingredients into an appetizing dish.  The ingredients are generally diverse items which are not commonly prepared together.<br/><br/>The chef competitors are given access to a pantry and refrigerator stocked with a wide variety of other ingredients, which they are free to use as they wish. Each round is timed (twenty or thirty minutes for the Appetizer round, thirty minutes each for the Entrée and Dessert rounds), and the chefs must cook their dishes and  complete four platings (three for the judges and one "beauty plate") before time runs out.<br/><br/>After each cooking round, there are three celebrity judges on hand to critique the dishes based on presentation, taste, and creativity.
