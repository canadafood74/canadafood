            Food bank For a Fed Latvia is a charity program in Latvia, which grew as one of the solutions of the 2008 financial crisis in Latvia in 2009.<br/><br/>Charity program "For a Fed Latvia" is held by Charitable organisation Ziedot.lv which is a charity portal that provides the possibility for individuals and companies to use the Internet to implement their desire to help those in need. Ziedot.lv offers a convenient and secure way to donate to carefully selected and approved charity projects, to follow project development and to be sure that the donation will reach its target.<br/><br/>Many people turn to Ziedot.lv every day, asking for support in finding a job to be able to feed their children.
