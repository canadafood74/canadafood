            Ketchup chips are a regional variety of potato chip that were created in the 1970s. Their creation is typically attributed to Hostess Potato Chips but they may have been invented during the same timeframe in the United States. Ketchup chips are strongly associated with Canadian identity due to their widespread availability in the country. They have limited production in the United States and the United Kingdom. The snack is recognized in popular culture.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The invention of ketchup chips is typically attributed to Hostess Potato Chips, which began experimenting with producing new potato chip varieties in the early 1970s. Ketchup chips were the only one that proved profitable as other flavours like orange and grape were discontinued. Herr's Snacks, an American company, sold ketchup chips by the 1980s. These chips may have been sold even earlier; if so, they would have been invented at the same time as Hostess. Herr's sold their chips in the United States, while Hostess only sold theirs in Canada.
