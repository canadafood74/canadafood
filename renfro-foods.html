            Renfro Foods, Inc. is a privately owned, award-winning food producer of salsas, sauces and relishes, including 30 Mrs. Renfro’s products, located in Fort Worth, Texas. Founded in 1940 as the George Renfro Food Company, Renfro Foods is now owned and managed by the second and third generations of the Renfro family. Its products are sold in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada and the U.K.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Renfro Foods was founded in 1940 as The George Renfro Food Company in the north Fort Worth, Texas garage of George and Arthurine Renfro; the company started there as a packaged spices and pepper sauce business.<br/><br/>In 1948, the company bought a local syrup manufacturer and Dixieland Syrups soon had wide distribution throughout Texas grocery stores. Four years later, Renfro acquired the formulas of Gold Star Foods and reworked the ingredients to make them taste more like family recipes. Before long, the company entered the jelly, preserve, vinegar and chow-chow business as well. By 1963, company sales had more than quadrupled.<br/><br/>In 1972, shortly after incorporating under its current name, Renfro Foods, Inc., the family purchased the recipes of Olé Foods, a Mexican-style hot sauce maker.
