            Clearly Canadian is a brand of premium sparkling waters produced by The Clearly Food &amp; Beverage Company Ltd., in British Columbia. The brand was founded in 1987 in British Columbia  and is widely recognized in United States, parts of Europe and Japan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Clearly Canadian was founded in 1987 by Gordon Sim, Doug Mason and others in British Columbia. It is often considered as one of the first premium "new age beverage" products, helping to pave way for the multibillion-dollar market in this category. The brand has produced its products every year since 1987, except for a brief haitus in 2010 and 2011.<br/><br/>Clearly Canadian experienced rapid market-dominating growth throughout the 1990s alongside Snapple and Red Bull, but fell into broad corporate mismanagement beginning in 2000 and up to 2012, when it was acquired by serial entrepreneur, Robert R. Khan, under his 4NCapital Partners investment firm. Large-scale commercial production resumed shortly thereafter in Canada and was precipitated by an online crowd-sourcing campaign that pre-sold in excess of 40,000 cases. Rhett and Link, celebrity hosts of internet comedy show "Good Mythical Morning", played a major role in promoting the campaign to save the beverage of their childhood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Timeline ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>1987: Clearly Canadian flavoured sparkling water is introduced.<br/><br/>1993: Annual sales hit $155 million.
