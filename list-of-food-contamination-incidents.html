            Food may be accidentally or deliberately contaminated by microbiological, chemical or physical hazards. In contrast to microbiologically caused foodborne illness, the link between exposure and effect of chemical hazards in foods is usually complicated by cumulative low doses and the delay between exposure and the onset of symptoms. Chemical hazards include environmental contaminants, food ingredients (such as iodine), heavy metals, mycotoxins, natural toxins, improper storage, processing contaminants, and veterinary medicines. Incidents have occurred because of poor harvesting or storage of grain, use of banned veterinary products, industrial discharges, human error and deliberate adulteration and fraud.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Definition of an incident ==<br/><br/>An "incident" of chemical food contamination may be defined as an episodic occurrence of adverse health effects in humans (or animals that might be consumed by humans) following high exposure to particular chemicals, or instances where episodically high concentrations of chemical hazards were detected in the food chain and traced back to a particular event.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Socio-economic impacts ==<br/><br/>Information on the impacts of these incidents is fragmentary and unsystematic, ranging from thousands of dollars to meet the cost of monitoring analysis, to many millions of dollars due to court prosecutions, bankruptcy, product disposal, compensation for revenue loss, damage to brand or reputation, or loss of life.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== List of notable incidents ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Ancient times ===<br/><br/>Roman Empire – There is speculation that the Romans, in particular the elite, suffered severe chronic lead poisoning due to the ubiquity of lead in e.g. lined pots in which acidic foodstuffs were boiled, over and above any mere exposure to lead in water pipes. They also used sugar of lead to sweeten their wines.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Middle Ages ===<br/><br/>Europe – numerous incidents of human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from grain infected with ergot fungi<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 19th century ===<br/><br/>1850s – Swill milk scandal in New York<br/><br/>1857 – adulteration of bread with alum in London, causing rickets.
