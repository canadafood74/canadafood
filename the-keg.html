            The Keg is a Canadian-owned chain of steakhouse restaurants and bars operating in both Canada and the United States. The first location, originally named "The Keg and Cleaver" restaurant, was founded in 1971 by George Tidball in North Vancouver, British Columbia. By February 2018, The Keg had expanded to 160 locations in Canada and the United States, when Canadian food industry giant Cara Operations (now known as Recipe Unlimited) purchased the chain for $200 million from then owners David Aisenstat (49%) and Fairfax Financial (51%). The chain is also recognized as The Keg Steakhouse + Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The company was founded in 1971 in North Vancouver, British Columbia as The Keg 'n Cleaver by George Tidball at one small, downstairs location in a former industrial building in the Moodyville area of lower Lonsdale. Today it operates in nine provinces (excluding only Prince Edward Island) and five American states.<br/><br/>The Keg purchased some historic properties, refurbishing them and turning them into restaurants. Examples of this are the Keg Mansion in Toronto and the Keg Manor at the Maplelawn Estate in Ottawa. The Downtown Winnipeg location opened in 1975 as The Keg and Cleaver in the former Hudson's Bay Company Garage on Garry Street, where it still operates today. Other notable heritage restorations are the Keg in Kamloops, British Columbia, which was a CN Station; and in New Westminster, British Columbia, formerly the city's CPR station.
