            Food Basics was a no-frills discount supermarket chain owned and operated by The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company in the northeastern United States.<br/><br/>Food Basics carried major national brands, as well as A&amp;P's portfolio of private labels, including America's Choice, A&amp;P's flagship private label, Food Basics and Home Basics, Live Better, and Green Way.  The stores also included brands usually not carried by other A&amp;P family stores.<br/><br/>Food Basics, like the rest of A&amp;P’s operations, was liquidated and closed in 2015. The name and trademark was purchased by Allegiance Retail Services, which also purchased the name and trademark for Food Basics’ former corporate sibling Pathmark.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Food Basics concept began in 1995 in Canada, where it was launched by A&amp;P's Canadian subsidiary. As of 2009, the two chains were no longer connected as the Canadian Food Basics stores are now owned and operated by Metro Inc., which purchased A&amp;P's Canadian stores.<br/><br/>In 2001, A&amp;P brought the Food Basics concept to the U.S., reopening its closed A&amp;P supermarket in Passaic, New Jersey, as its first Food Basics in the US.  A&amp;P was pleased with the results and within several months of opening the Passaic store, A&amp;P decided to expand the Food Basics banner into nearby Paterson, and renovated an A&amp;P store there.<br/><br/>Some of the new Food Basics stores had been part of the A&amp;P family for decades, including the Paterson store mentioned above, with A&amp;P's former Atlantic Regional headquarters nearby; in fact, before a separate building was constructed in the 1970s, A&amp;P operated its store inside the headquarters building.<br/><br/>Other Food Basics stores, such as the Wallington, New Jersey, Food Basics store, became part of A&amp;P when the chain purchased Stop &amp; Shop's New York Metro division in 1982.
