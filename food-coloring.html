            Food coloring, color additive or colorant is any dye, pigment, or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or beverages. Colorants can be supplied as liquids, powders, gels, or pastes. Food coloring is commonly used in commercial products and in domestic cooking.<br/><br/>Food colorants are also used in various non-food applications, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects, and medical devices. Some colorings may be natural, such as with carotenoids and anthocyanins extracted from plants or cochineal from insects, or may be synthesized, such as tartrazine yellow.<br/><br/>In the manufacturing of foods, beverages and cosmetics, the safety of colorants is under constant scientific review and certification by national regulatory agencies, such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and by international reviewers, such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Purpose of food coloring ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>People associate certain colors with certain flavors, and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine. Sometimes, the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural, such as adding red coloring to glacé cherries (which would otherwise be beige), but sometimes it is for effect, like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 2000. Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including:<br/><br/><br/><br/>To make food more attractive, appealing, appetizing, and informative<br/><br/>Offsetting color loss over time due to exposure to light, air, temperature extremes, moisture and storage conditions<br/><br/>Stabilizing natural variations in color<br/><br/>Enhancing colors that occur naturally<br/><br/>Providing color to colorless and "fun" foods<br/><br/>Allowing products to be identified at sight, like candy flavors or medicine dosages<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Natural food dyes ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== History ===<br/><br/>The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC, when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products' appearance. During the Middle Ages, the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture, and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities.
